    <div class="prose prose-lg text-[#4A4A4A]">
      <p>GoFixr is the <strong>WebMD for your home</strong> — a free resource that helps homeowners diagnose problems, estimate costs, and make smart decisions about home repairs.</p>
      <p>We believe every homeowner deserves transparent, honest information about what home repairs actually cost and which projects you can tackle yourself. Our calculators use real industry data and formulas — no hidden lead-gen forms, no bait-and-switch quotes.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1B4965] mt-8">Our Tools</h2>
      <p>Every calculator on GoFixr performs real mathematical calculations based on industry-standard formulas, material coverage rates, and regional cost data. We don't just slap a contact form behind a "Get Estimate" button.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1B4965] mt-8">Safety First</h2>
      <p>We always tell you when a project requires a licensed professional. Electrical work, gas lines, structural changes, and certain plumbing jobs should be left to the pros. Your safety is more important than saving a few bucks.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1B4965] mt-8">Disclaimer</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-500">GoFixr provides estimates for informational purposes only. Actual costs vary by location, project complexity, material choices, and contractor availability. Always get multiple quotes from licensed professionals for major projects.</p>
