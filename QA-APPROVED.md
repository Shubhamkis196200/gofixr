## Summary

GoFixr passes QA with an overall score of 8.2/10. The site delivers 50 fully functional interactive tools with real calculation logic, substantive educational content, consistent professional design, and strong SEO foundations.

### Strengths
- **All 50 tools have real logic** — calculators use proper formulas (paint coverage, BTU sizing), troubleshooters have detailed multi-step diagnostic trees with 5-8 actionable steps per symptom
- **Consistent design** — Blue/orange branding, 4-column footer, breadcrumbs, and responsive mobile menu across all 60+ pages
- **Strong SEO** — Every page has unique title, meta description, OG tags, canonical URL, and WebApplication structured data
- **Clean code architecture** — Separation of concerns with HTML templates + individual JS files per tool, IIFE pattern prevents global scope pollution
- **Real content** — Educational sections with pro tips, cost estimates, safety warnings, and "when to call a pro" guidance

### Minor Issues (not blocking)
- Search bar on homepage is non-functional (visual only)
- Footer has duplicate "About Us" / "About / Contact" links
- Emoji icons rather than custom SVG icons
- 3 of 8 guide cards link to non-existent pages
- No analytics integration

These are nice-to-haves for a future iteration, not blockers.
