### Tier 2 — Content / DIY Authorities

| Competitor | Focus | What They Do Well |
|---|---|---|
| **iFixit** (ifixit.com) | Device/appliance repair guides | Step-by-step teardown guides, parts marketplace, community wiki model, strong E-E-A-T |

- **Taskrabbit** — gig-economy handyman marketplace
- **Handy** (handy.com) — cleaning & handyman booking
- **Ace Handyman Services** — franchise network with local SEO

### Key Competitor Gaps (Our Opportunity)
- Big marketplaces focus on lead gen, NOT on helping homeowners actually understand/fix things
- Content sites (Family Handyman, Bob Vila) have great guides but LACK interactive tools
- Cost estimator sites (HomeGuide, Costimates) have calculators but LACK comprehensive DIY guidance
- iFixit is brilliant for electronics but WEAK on home structural/plumbing/electrical repair
- **Nobody combines: interactive tools + DIY guides + cost transparency + "should I hire?" decision support**

### Color Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| **Safety Orange** | `#FF6B35` | Primary CTA, tool accents, brand mark |
| **Tool Blue** | `#1B4965` | Headers, navigation, trust elements |

### Design Principles
- **Clean, tool-like interface** — calculators and tools should feel functional, not decorative
- **Mobile-first** — 70%+ of home repair searches happen on mobile (person standing in front of broken thing)
- **Large, tappable buttons** — users may have dirty/gloved hands
- **Step-by-step visual flow** — numbered steps with clear photos/illustrations
- **Before/After imagery** — builds trust and shows competence
- **Difficulty ratings** — every guide shows ⭐ difficulty, ⏱ time estimate, 💰 cost range

### Trust Signals
- "Reviewed by licensed contractor" badges on guides
- Clear difficulty/danger warnings for electrical/plumbing
- "When to call a pro" callout boxes
- Real cost data with sources cited
- Safety disclaimers prominent but not obstructive
- User-submitted photos of completed repairs
- Contractor verification badges (if doing lead gen)

### Layout Patterns
- **Homepage**: Search-first (like WebMD for homes) — "What needs fixing?" search bar
- **Tool pages**: Input form → instant results → educational content below
- **Guide pages**: Hero image → difficulty/time/cost summary card → numbered steps → related tools sidebar
- **Cost pages**: Price range header → detailed breakdown → calculator embed → get quotes CTA

## 6. Unique Angle — GoFixr Positioning

### Brand Positioning
**"The WebMD for your home"** — Diagnose the problem, understand the fix, decide whether to DIY or hire.

### What Makes GoFixr Different

1. **Diagnosis-First Approach**: Start with the symptom ("my toilet is running"), not the solution. Interactive troubleshooters guide users to the right fix — no other site does this well.

2. **Fix Confidence Score**: Every repair guide includes a "Can I Fix This?" assessment based on skill level, tools needed, time required, and risk. Users self-assess and get a recommendation.

3. **Honest Cost Transparency**: Real-time, zip-code-specific cost data. No lead-gen bait — show the actual numbers upfront. Build trust by NOT hiding behind "get a free quote" walls.

4. **Tool-First SEO Moat**: 45+ free interactive tools that generate organic traffic. Competitors have content; we have content + tools.

5. **The "Fix Library"**: Structured, searchable database of fixes organized by room → system → symptom → solution. Like iFixit but for houses.

6. **Safety-First Content**: Clear warnings when DIY is dangerous (electrical, gas, structural). Positions us as trustworthy, not reckless.

7. **No-Bloat Guides**: Fast-loading, step-by-step, photo-rich. No 2,000-word intros before getting to the fix. Respect the user's time (and their flooding bathroom).

### Target Audience
- **Primary**: Homeowners 28-55, first-time and experienced, who want to understand what's wrong and what it costs before deciding to DIY or hire
- **Secondary**: Renters needing quick fixes, landlords managing properties
- **Tertiary**: New homeowners overwhelmed by maintenance responsibilities

### Brand Voice
- **Confident but approachable** — like a knowledgeable neighbor, not a condescending contractor
- **Direct and practical** — get to the fix fast
- **Honest about limitations** — "this is a pro job" when it is
- **Encouraging for DIY** — "you can do this" with clear steps

### Go-To-Market Priority
1. **Phase 1** (Month 1-3): Launch 50+ repair guides + 10 calculators targeting highest-volume keywords
2. **Phase 2** (Month 4-6): Add troubleshooter tools + cost guides + begin affiliate monetization
3. **Phase 3** (Month 7-12): Scale to 200+ guides, 30+ tools, launch lead gen test, apply for Mediavine/Raptive
4. **Phase 4** (Year 2): Community features, contractor directory, video content, mobile app
